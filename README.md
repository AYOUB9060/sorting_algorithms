#Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in C programming language. Each algorithm is provided as a separate C file and can be used to sort different types of data.

##Introduction

Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are used to arrange elements in a particular order. This repository showcases different sorting algorithms, each with its own strengths and characteristics. The provided implementations are written in C for educational purposes and can be used as a reference for understanding the underlying concepts of each algorithm.
